## 📝 Project Description  
*DevMerge* is a real-time collaborative coding platform built with the *MERN* stack. It enables developers to code together seamlessly, supporting multiple users in a shared environment with live updates and syntax highlighting. DevMerge is ideal for:

- 👨‍💻 Pair programming  
- 🎯 Remote coding interviews  
- 👥 Group coding sessions  

The platform emphasizes efficiency, interactivity, and real-time collaboration for developers across different locations.
